Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

## tl;dr

- Abusive behavior is never tolerated. 
- Violating this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the Fiddler Everywhere community channels.

## Scope

We expect all members of the Fiddler Everywhere community, including administrators, users, facilitators, and vendors, to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in our community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to Fiddler Everywhere affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the Fiddler Everywhere GitHub repositories, the Fiddler Everywhere website, and any Fiddler Everywhere-related events. This Code of Conduct is in addition to and does not in any way nullify or invalidate any other terms or conditions related to the use of Fiddler Everywhere.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the Fiddler Everywhere administrators.

## Friendly, Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices and acknowledge that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single correct answer. A difference in technology preferences is never a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is unwelcome and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users of Fiddler Everywhere is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes but is not limited to:
Harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.
Inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces.
Threats of physical or non-physical harm.
Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
Harassing photography or recording.
Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
Inappropriate physical contact.
Unwelcome sexual attention.

## Acceptable Content

The Fiddler Everywhere administrators reserve the right to make judgment calls about what is and isn't appropriate in published content. These are guidelines to help you be successful in our community.

Content must contain something applicable to the previously stated goals of the Fiddler Everywhere community. "Spamming", that is, publishing any form of content that is not applicable, is not allowed.

Content must not contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content to Fiddler Everywhere properties if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. You will be responsible for violating laws or others' intellectual property rights.

Content must not be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) that is designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems is not allowed.

Content name, description, and other visible metadata must not include abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, don't hesitate to get in touch with the administrators and send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

## Consequences

All content published to the Fiddler Everywhere community channels is hosted at the sole discretion of the Fiddler Everywhere administrators.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Fiddler Everywhere administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the administrators. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

## Contact Info
Please contact Nick Iliev if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.

You are also encouraged to contact us if you are curious about something that might be "on the line" between appropriate and inappropriate content. We are happy to provide guidance to help you be a successful part of our community.
